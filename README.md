# WeightedVotingOnBlockchain

Hey everyone,
So this is the third project i have done in the series of understanding ethereum environment.Not much complications in this project,just used the characteristics of truffle as much as i can. Some important points regarding this projects are :-

#1 Truffle testing - This is the utility given by truffle to test the smart contract before deploying it.It is very important because a smart contract becomes immutable after deployment, so we have to test it thoroughly before deploying.Tests can be written in solidity or java-script.I have used both though i am much comfortable with solidity as of now.

#2 Contract deployment on test-network - I deployed my contract on ropsten test network ( Network Id - 3) and did some transaction using meta mask and infura.

#3 Web3.js - This is the thin rope which connects your front end with blockchain and i recommend to have command on this framework(though i am also not very comfortable with it as i have not done any java-script project earlier).

So, you can go and clone it,use it,try to change the contract and happy to have any advancement in that.

Here is the screenshot of the front-end.

P.s - I have done this project with the help of www.Zastrin.com. Go check it out!
